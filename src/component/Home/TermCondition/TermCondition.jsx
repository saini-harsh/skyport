              These Terms and Conditions of Service (“Terms”) form a legally binding agreement between the User (“you”) and SkyPort Destinations (“SkyPort,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). They govern your use of our online flight search, booking, and ticketing platform and services. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use our services. Use of the SkyPort platform indicates acceptance of these Terms in full.

            </p>

            <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
            <p>
              SkyPort Destinations is a premium online travel agency that exclusively facilitates real-time global flight bookings. We act as an intermediary to authorized inventory and fare sources, providing booking capabilities and customer support. SkyPort does not operate any airline, nor do we provide transportation or travel insurance.<br />
              Your booking creates a contract between you and the airline, not SkyPort. By completing a booking, you agree to be bound by the airline’s terms of carriage, fare rules, and refund/change policies.

            </p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility &amp; Use of Platform</h2>
            <p>
              Only individuals over 18 years with legal capacity may use this platform. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information. Speculative, fraudulent, or duplicate bookings are strictly prohibited. <br />
              SkyPort reserves the right to cancel bookings and suspend or terminate user access for violation of these Terms.

            </p>

            <h2>3. Ordering and Booking of Tickets</h2>
            <p>
              All bookings made through SkyPort are subject to real-time availability and airline fare rules. By submitting a booking request, the customer instructs SkyPort to proceed on their behalf to reserve the ticket under the terms defined by the selected airline. Bookings may be held on a temporary basis until payment is completed, but SkyPort cannot guarantee the availability or fare until payment authorization and ticket issuance are both successfully completed.<br />
              It is the sole responsibility of the customer to: - Ensure that all traveler names and identification match the passport or official travel document exactly. - Review and understand the airline’s fare rules, baggage allowances, change/cancellation conditions, and refund policy before confirming the booking. - Verify that all travel dates, destination(s), connection times, and layovers are accurate and suitable. - Ensure the currency of travel documents including passport validity, visas, and applicable entry or transit authorizations. - Accurately input passenger information, including gender, title, date of birth, and nationality where required.<br />
              SkyPort is not liable for any loss resulting from customer errors or omissions during the booking process. This includes, but is not limited to, misspelled names, incorrect travel dates, or choosing the wrong destination. Once a booking has been submitted, any corrections are subject to airline approval and may incur penalties or require the issuance of a new ticket.<br />
              Bookings are confirmed only upon the issuance of an electronic ticket (e-ticket) with a valid airline reservation code (PNR). Customers will receive a booking confirmation email that includes the details of the transaction. Any booking confirmation received without an attached e-ticket number is not considered a final confirmation.<br />
              SkyPort reserves the right to cancel or refuse bookings where there is evidence of fraud, system manipulation, inaccurate fare publication, or violation of the airline’s or our terms. In such cases, the customer will be notified and refunded in accordance with the applicable policies. (Per API Agreement - Section 3)<br />
              All bookings made via SkyPort are subject to real-time airline availability. By placing a booking, you instruct SkyPort to proceed on your behalf under the terms defined by the selected airline. Bookings may be held for a limited time pending payment and airline ticketing confirmation.
              SkyPort does not guarantee fare availability or pricing until full payment and ticket issuance is completed. Once a booking is placed, modifications are subject to airline fare rules.

            </p>

            <h2>4. Price</h2>
            <p>
              Flight prices are governed by the respective airlines or their authorized global distribution partners. All prices displayed on SkyPort’s platform include base fares, applicable taxes, and mandatory surcharges. Prices are dynamic and are not guaranteed until ticket issuance. <br />
              Due to the use of real-time APIs and third-party inventory feeds, pricing discrepancies may occur between the fare initially displayed and the fare available at the time of final payment. These discrepancies may arise due to API synchronization delays, changes in seat inventory, fare updates from suppliers, or system outages. SkyPort makes every effort to ensure accuracy but cannot be held liable for such changes.<br />
              In the event of a fare discrepancy discovered between booking submission and payment authorization, SkyPort will notify the customer. You will then be provided the opportunity to confirm the revised price or cancel the booking without penalty. No ticket will be issued unless the customer accepts the adjusted fare and authorizes the new transaction total.<br />
              SkyPort does not offer or guarantee fare locks unless explicitly offered by the airline and supported through our systems. If a fare lock service is available, the terms (duration, fee, eligibility) will be clearly disclosed at the time of selection. Locked fares will only be honored within the validity period and are subject to final availability verification at the time of payment.<br />
              SkyPort is not responsible for:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Currency exchange rate fluctuations</li>
                <li>Errors in third-party data feeds</li>
                <li>Expired or withdrawn fare classes</li>
                <li>User payment delays leading to fare lapses</li>
              </ul>
              All fare components and total costs are displayed at checkout. The customer acknowledges that clicking ‘Book Now’ constitutes agreement to the fare shown at that time, subject to final ticketing availability.<br />
              Flight prices are set and governed by the airline or their global distribution partner. All displayed fares are inclusive of applicable airline base fares, taxes, and surcharges. Prices are dynamic and subject to change until ticket issuance.<br />
              SkyPort is not responsible for price changes due to:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Currency fluctuations</li>
                <li>Delays in payment</li>
                <li>Expired fare windows</li>
                <li>Airline repricing errors</li>
              </ul>

              In the event of a fare change post-booking but pre-ticket issuance, the customer will be notified and offered the option to proceed at the revised price or cancel the booking without penalty.

            </p>

            <h2>5. Ticket Issuance</h2>
            <p>
              SkyPort will issue tickets only upon:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Successful payment authorization</li>
                <li>Fare and PNR verification by the airline</li>
                <li>Confirmation of booking class and seat availability</li>

              </ul>
              A valid e-ticket number and PNR will be sent upon completion. Ticket issuance is conditional and may be denied if discrepancies arise, including booking errors, fare increases, system malfunctions, or issues flagged during airline security or fraud checks.<br />
              In the rare event that payment is authorized but the ticket is not successfully issued, SkyPort will notify the customer promptly. Possible remedies include:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Full refund of the charged amount if no ticket was issued</li>
                <li>Option to accept a revised itinerary or fare, if available and acceptable to the customer</li>
                <li>Reattempt of ticket issuance upon resolution of the issue (subject to airline confirmation)</li>
              </ul>

              SkyPort is not liable for delays caused by third-party systems, airline failures, or inventory expiration. Ticket issuance times may vary depending on airline confirmation processes and fraud screening protocols. SkyPort disclaims all responsibility for missed departures or consequential losses arising from delayed ticket issuance due to force majeure or airline-side complications.<br />
              Customers are advised not to proceed with travel arrangements such as visa appointments or ground bookings until the e-ticket has been received and verified.<br />
              SkyPort will issue tickets only upon:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Successful payment authorization</li>
                <li>Fare and PNR verification by the airline</li>
                <li>Confirmation of booking class and seat availability</li>
              </ul>

              A valid e-ticket number and PNR will be sent upon completion. Ticket issuance is conditional and may be denied if discrepancies arise. SkyPort is not liable for delays due to third-party system failures or payment verification issues.

            </p>

            <h2>6. Payments</h2>
            <p>
              SkyPort accepts only Visa-branded credit and debit card payments. All transactions must be fully authorized, securely encrypted, and settled before ticket issuance. Payment authorization includes a fraud risk assessment and verification by our payment gateway and associated financial institutions.<br />
              The customer is solely responsible for ensuring that the card used is valid, has sufficient funds, and is authorized for international transactions. SkyPort reserves the right to decline any payment that fails fraud screening, violates our payment policies, or originates from high-risk jurisdictions.<br />
              In the event of a payment failure or reversal (including chargebacks or unauthorized disputes), SkyPort may cancel the booking, deny future access, and pursue collection or legal remedies where applicable. Bookings associated with declined or reversed payments will be voided without obligation for notification.<br />
              SkyPort does not store credit card data on its servers and complies with PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) to ensure secure transaction processing. All sensitive information is transmitted using SSL encryption protocols.<br />
              By proceeding with payment, the user acknowledges and agrees to these payment terms and authorizes SkyPort to charge the full transaction value, including applicable taxes, surcharges, and service fees.<br />
              You authorize SkyPort to:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Charge the total transaction amount</li>
                <li>Reattempt failed charges</li>
                <li>Process refunds (if approved by the airline)</li>
              </ul>

              Chargebacks, disputed transactions, or reversal of payment may result in cancellation of services and permanent account termination.

            </p>

            <h2>7. Taxes and Surcharges</h2>
            <p>
              Ticket prices include:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Airport taxes and fees</li>
                <li>Passenger safety fees</li>
                <li>Fuel surcharges</li>
                <li>Carrier-imposed service charges</li>
              </ul>

              SkyPort does not control tax amounts or surcharges, which are set by the airline or applicable regulators.

            </p>

            <h2>8. Refunds / Voids</h2>
            <p>
              Refunds and voids are governed entirely by the fare rules of the airline associated with the booking. SkyPort serves solely as a facilitator and is not responsible for refund approval or disbursement decisions made by the airline. <br />
              <strong>Customer Responsibilities for Refunds: -</strong> The customer must initiate the refund request via SkyPort’s customer service portal or by email within the time frame allowed by the airline. - The original booking reference and e-ticket number must be submitted at the time of request. - The customer must confirm that no portion of the ticket has been used. - For non-refundable fares, customers acknowledge that refund options may be limited to government taxes or airport charges only.<br />
              <strong>Refund Processing Procedure:</strong> 1. SkyPort will acknowledge receipt of the refund request within 3 business days. 2. The request will be submitted to the airline or system provider for verification and processing. 3. SkyPort will keep the customer updated periodically on the status of the refund. 4. Once approved by the airline, the amount (less non-refundable charges) will be returned to the original payment method.<br />
              <strong>Estimated Timelines: -</strong> Refunds may take up to 60–90 business days, depending on airline processing and financial system reconciliation. - In rare cases, refunds may be delayed beyond 90 days due to airline backlog, disputes, or audit issues.<br />
              <strong>Void Ticket Requests: -</strong> Void requests must be submitted within the same day of ticket issuance and before airline-imposed deadlines (typically within 24 hours). - Tickets that have been flown or partially used are not eligible for voiding.<br />
              <strong>Important Disclaimers: -</strong> SkyPort is not liable for refunds denied or delayed by the airline. - Service fees, administrative charges, and any airline penalties will be deducted from the refund amount where applicable. - If the airline permits rebooking or voucher issuance instead of a refund, the customer will be notified of available alternatives.<br />
              It is the customer’s responsibility to review airline-specific refund policies prior to booking and to monitor their email for all related correspondence. SkyPort reserves the right to deny any refund request that does not comply with the required process.<br />
              Refunds and voids are governed entirely by the airline’s fare rules and ticketing deadlines. SkyPort will facilitate refund processing where permitted but is not liable for refusal by the airline.
              Refund timelines may exceed 60–90 business days and are subject to:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Airline approval</li>
                <li>Administrative processing</li>
                <li>Deduction of non-refundable charges</li>

              </ul>

              Void requests must be made on the same day of ticket issuance and within airline system deadlines. After that period, standard cancellation rules apply.

            </p>

            <h2>9. Modifications, Rebooking &amp; Cancellations</h2>
            <p>
              Ticket modifications are not guaranteed and may incur airline-imposed penalties. SkyPort will process change requests if allowed by the fare class and rules. Customers are responsible for all fees and fare differences.<br />
              Cancellations are subject to:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Airline’s refundability terms</li>
                <li>Non-refundable ticket conditions</li>
                <li>Rebooking restrictions</li>
              </ul>

            </p>

            <h2>10. Passport, Visa &amp; Entry Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              It is solely your responsibility to ensure full compliance with all applicable travel-related documentation, laws, and requirements imposed by the country of departure, transit, and destination. This includes, but is not limited to: <br />
              <ul>
                <li>Ensuring passport validity extends beyond the required minimum (commonly six months from the date of travel)</li>
                <li>Obtaining all necessary visas (tourist, business, transit, or otherwise) well in advance</li>
                <li>Fulfilling all health and vaccination requirements, including COVID-19 testing, proof of immunization, or quarantine mandates</li>
                <li>Complying with the rules of immigration, customs, and security authorities at all applicable airports or border crossings</li>
                <li>Reviewing the specific airline’s requirements for check-in times, identification, and supporting documents</li>
              </ul>
              Failure to comply with these requirements may result in denied boarding, refused entry into the destination country, fines, deportation, or other penalties, for which SkyPort assumes no liability.<br />
              Travelers are strongly advised to consult with the relevant embassy, consulate, or immigration authority prior to booking to ensure eligibility and avoid potential disruptions. No refunds, credits, or remedies shall be issued by SkyPort for travel interruptions resulting from a passenger’s failure to obtain required documents or adhere to entry rules.<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Passport validity rules</li>
                <li>Entry visas or transit visas</li>
                <li>COVID-19 or health-related documentation</li>
                <li>Immigration and customs regulations</li>
              </ul>
              SkyPort is not liable for denied boarding or entry due to incorrect or incomplete documentation. No refund will be granted in such cases.

            </p>

            <h2>11. Content and Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
              SkyPort endeavors to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date fare data, flight schedules, and booking content sourced from trusted third-party inventory systems. However, due to the nature of real-time data feeds and reliance on airline-controlled systems, SkyPort does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content displayed on the platform. Any and all platform content, including flight options, routing, travel times, seat availability, and pricing, are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis without express or implied warranties of any kind.<br />
              SkyPort shall not be held liable for errors, omissions, or changes made by third parties, including but not limited to airlines, global distribution systems (GDS), or API inventory providers. Changes to flight schedules, gate assignments, availability, and price updates may occur without notice, and such changes are beyond SkyPort’s control. Users acknowledge that reliance on displayed content is at their own risk.<br />
              In addition, while SkyPort strives to maintain operational uptime and consistent user access, system interruptions, maintenance, or technical malfunctions may disrupt content delivery. SkyPort disclaims all warranties regarding uninterrupted, error-free access to the platform or the accuracy of the information retrieved therein.<br />
              Users are strongly encouraged to independently verify critical travel data directly with the operating carrier prior to travel. SkyPort shall not be responsible for decisions made by users based solely on platform content that later proves outdated, inaccurate, or superseded by airline actions or external events

            </p>

            <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              All trademarks, logos, trade names, visual content, platform interfaces, and proprietary source code (collectively, the “Intellectual Property”) are the exclusive property of SkyPort Destinations or its third-party licensors and are protected under applicable copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana and international jurisdictions.<br />
              Unauthorized use, copying, reproduction, distribution, modification, publication, display, or reverse engineering of any component of the SkyPort platform is strictly prohibited and may result in civil or criminal penalties. Users agree not to access or attempt to access any source code, algorithms, or data not intentionally made available to them through the platform.<br />
              This clause is guided by the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, WIPO treaties, and local IP laws. Violators may be subject to immediate suspension of services, legal action, and compensation claims for resulting damages.

            </p>

            <h2>13. Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
            <p>
              You agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of SkyPort services, any transaction conducted through SkyPort, or these Terms—including but not limited to contract disputes, tort claims, misrepresentation, or statutory violations—shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered under the Arbitration Act of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana.<br />
              The arbitration shall take place in Georgetown, Guyana, before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or appointed in accordance with the Guyana Arbitration Act if agreement cannot be reached. The proceedings shall be conducted in English, and the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br />
              You expressly waive your right to a jury trial and to participate in any class action, collective, or representative proceedings. Each party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses, unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator. The arbitration clause shall survive termination of your access to the SkyPort platform or any other agreement between you and SkyPort.<br />
              Nothing in this clause shall prevent SkyPort from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in a court of law to protect its intellectual property, platform integrity, or proprietary data systems, nor shall it preclude filing claims for payment recovery or fraud prevention in the courts of Guyana.<br />
              This clause shall survive termination of your use of the services.

            </p>

            <h2>14. Updates and Changes</h2>
            <p>
              SkyPort reserves the right to update these Terms without prior notice. Material changes will be posted on our website, and your continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

            </p>

            <h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              To the fullest extent permitted by law, SkyPort disclaims all liability for direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or goodwill, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.<br />

              All transportation, security screening, and immigration-related risks are borne solely by the traveler. SkyPort acts only as an intermediary between the customer and the airline or travel service provider and shall not be held responsible for their acts, errors, omissions, warranties, breaches, or negligence.<br />
              In any case, SkyPort’s total aggregate liability for any claim relating to the use of its services shall not exceed the amount of the booking fee paid by the customer for the affected transaction.<br />
              This limitation of liability shall apply regardless of the legal theory upon which the claim is based and shall survive termination or expiration of these Terms.<br />
              To the fullest extent permitted by law, SkyPort disclaims all liability for:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>Airline service failures</li>

            <h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>17. Severability</h2>
            <p>
              If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

            </p>

            <h2>18. Entire Agreement</h2>

              These Terms and Conditions represent the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between the user and SkyPort Destinations concerning access to and use of all services, including but not limited to flight search, booking, and ticketing functionalities.

No oral statements or correspondence shall modify these Terms unless formally executed as an amendment to this agreement. In the event of conflict between these Terms and any other document or communication, these Terms shall prevail.<br />
              By continuing to access or use the SkyPort platform and its services, users acknowledge and affirm that they have read, understood, and accepted these Terms in full, and that these Terms are enforceable under the applicable laws of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana and any relevant international legal standards.
